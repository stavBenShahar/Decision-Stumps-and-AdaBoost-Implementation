# Decision-Stumps-and-AdaBoost-Implementation
 Implement a Decision Stump classifier and AdaBoost algorithm. Train AdaBoost using Decision Stumps on noisy and noise-free datasets. Analyze training/test errors, decision boundaries, sample weights, and the effect of noise using cross-validation. Compare Ridge and Lasso regularizations using cross-validation and evaluate model performance.
